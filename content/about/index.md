## Who?

I am Joaquin Cabezas, and here I will write on Machine Learning. I am currently working as Machine Learning Engineer at Adevinta, focused on Computer Vision and NLP.

## Why is there no content and/or web design?

I've just published a simple structure so I can start focusing on some poorly written drafts. In due time, these will evolve into poorly written articles.

## Why is there no cookie banner?

Because I don't use cookies. My approach here is to not gather any data from readers and do not allow others to gather this data. Also,
this means there is no 'subcription' mechanism other than RSS (Really Simple Syndication). The technical setup is done according to this
goals.
